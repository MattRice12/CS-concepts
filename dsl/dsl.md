#What is DSL
  The term Domain Specific Language (DSL) has become very popular in the Ruby space. One popular example is the Make replacement Rake, particularly after an article by Martin Fowler  about it. The term DSL is also used to describe some of the concepts in ActiveRecord, which is part of Ruby on Rails.

  A Domain-Specific Language, or DSL, is “a programming language of limited expressiveness focused on a particular domain”. It makes tasks in its domain easier by removing extraneous code for a particular task and allowing you to focus on the specific task at hand. It also helps other people read the code, because the purpose of the code is so clear.

  DSL is a custom language designed to solve a specific problem.
  Some examples of DSL's listed are unix mini (or little) languages, such as sed, awk, troff, m4 or make. The list is quite long, and actually, could go on forever, since most any language, computer based or not, could be considered a DSL.
  From my work, I see DSLs used for two main purposes. One, is as a friendly way to provide data (configuration or otherwise) to a program. The other is a friendly way to let users write business rules for a particular task. This is usually motivated by the desire to let the end user write code without realizing they are actually coding.
