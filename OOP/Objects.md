*Classes*
  Object-oriented programming very much fits the way we perceive and think about the world, at least in Western culture. Our way of thinking was, historically, very much influenced by Plato, and philosophers who followed him:
    - We somehow tend to think about the world as if there are abstract “ideas” (or concepts) and concrete “things”, which are entities of the ideas, or implementations of the concepts. So, “ideas” are like blueprints for “things”.

    @Example: There’s the idea of a human being, and then there are actual human beings: you, and me. Our idea of a human being includes the ability to, for example, remember our own name, and tell it to others when asked. We know that we can ask people for their name, and they’ll know it.

    - In OOP languages “ideas” are called classes. And actual “things” are called objects.

  As a programmer you would define classes, like a class “User” and a class “Tweet”, and then create actual instances of these classes: an actual concrete user with a name, email address, a password and actual tweets. You would also define that users have the ability to remember their own name, and the ability to tell it to others when asked.

*Variables*
  A variable itself is not a “thing”. It’s just a name we associate with a thing (an object).
